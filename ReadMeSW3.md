# MFELEC1 Seatwork No. 3

This seatwork integrates 3 tools we used in our WSN lessons: RPi, Python, and Node-RED.
The activity is divided into three parts:

## 1. Multiple Choice Questions (30-item)
- Open the Terminal, then type _python sw3.py_
- Answer the seatwork but make sure to login first. (username: **dlsu_id**, password: **surname**)
- Do not forget your score in the seatwork. Just in case you forgot, your scores are stored in my git repo.

## 2. Node-RED (send score via e-mail)
- In your terminal, type _node-red_
- Open Chromium and type the URL used for Node-RED.
- Edit the 2nd flow by changing the let variables (name, id, score, email)
- Press _Deploy_ then the manual inject to send your score to my e-mail.

## 3. End Session
- Close all the applications.
- Reboot the RPi.
